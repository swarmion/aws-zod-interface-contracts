# Get started on AWS

Your project is generated, it is almost ready to be deployed to AWS.

## Configure the deploy user

In order to deploy the stack on a development environment, you will need to setup a user on the stack.

:::caution
This step is only for the _development_ environment. For _staging_ and _production_ environment,
we recommend following the guidelines in the [configure your CI/CD section](../how-to-guides/configure-ci-cd).
:::

- Head to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/users)
- Add a new user, give it a name (we will use `swarmion-dev` in the following steps)
- In "AWS access type", select "Programmatic access", then click on "Next: permissions"
- Click on the "Attach existing policies directly", then select "AdministratorAccess" and click on "Next: tags"
- Click "Next: review", then "Create user"
- Do not close the window yet
- Open a terminal and run: `aws configure --profile swarmion-dev`
- Fill in the Access Key Id and the Secret Access Key from your user
- For the region, use the AWS region chosen for your project. See [the list of AWS regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)
- Leave the default output format prompt empty, as the default is `json`
- Change the dev profile name in `sharedConfig.ts`:
  ```typescript title="packages/serverless-configuration/src/sharedConfig.ts"
  export const sharedParams = {
    dev: { profile: 'swarmion-dev' },
    staging: { profile: '' }, // leave empty for staging
    production: { profile: '' }, // leave empty for production
  };
  ```

## Deploy the stacks

At the root of the project, run `pnpm run deploy`. This will compile and deploy all the stacks in order.
You can follow the creation of the stacks on [the Cloudformation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

:::note
At this time, there is only one stack in the project, the `core` stack. We will deploy another stack in the next step of the tutorial.
:::

The following architecture is deployed:

import backendCoreArchitecture from '../../static/schemas/core-architecture.png';

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    'justify-content': 'center',
    'margin-bottom': 'var(--ifm-leading)',
  }}
>
  <img src={backendCoreArchitecture} alt="core architecture" width="500px" />
</div>

An HTTP API Gateway and a Lamda called `my-project-name-core-dev-health`.

The API Gateway exposes an endpoint `GET /health` which is an integration with the Lambda. Calling the endpoint will execute the Lambda and return the result.

To call the endpoint, you can find the _Invoke URL_ of your API Gateway in the [AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=us-east-1), then append `/health` and call it, for example:

```bash
http https://b1c15ee1u8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/health

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Apigw-Requestid: XHjHzjQcIAMEVBA=
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 2
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2022 15:54:26 GMT

ok
```

:::info
Here we use the neat [httpie](https://httpie.org) command line tool to call the endpoint.
:::

## Deploy a change to the stack

Let's change the result of the `health` lambda and deploy it.

Go to `services/core/functions/health/handler.ts` and replace the existing code with the following:

```typescript title="services/core/functions/health/handler.ts"
export const main = async (): Promise<string> => {
  return Promise.resolve('Hello Swarmion üêù');
};
```

Then deploy the stack by running the following commands in a terminal located at the root of the project:

```bash
cd services/core
pnpm run deploy
```

When you call the endpoint, we can see the updated result:

```bash
http https://b1c15ee1u8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/health

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Apigw-Requestid: XHn0shXfoAMEVdQ=
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 19
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2022 16:26:31 GMT

Hello Swarmion üêù
```

:::info
When, like in this case, you only need update the source code of a lambda, there is no need to deploy the whole stack. You can use the following command to solely deploy the lambda:

```bash
pnpm serverless deploy function -f health
```

:::

## Wrap up

You now have successfully deployed your project to AWS in a dev environment. It is still a fairly simple one with a single serverless service. In the next part, we will add a second serverless service to the project üöÄ
