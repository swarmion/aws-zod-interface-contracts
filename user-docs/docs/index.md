# Introduction

Welcome to Swarmion! If this is the first time on this framework, you've come to the right place!

:::note
We are trying to build a step-by-step documentation to get familiar with Swarmion. If you find any unclear instructions, please [open an issue on Swarmion](https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/issues).
:::

Serverless allows us virtually infinite scalability with demand. For your project to blossom, you also need a scalable code base. That is where swarming comes into play.

To achieve this we give you an opinionated framework that relies on

- Microservices
- Typescript
- Development tools

:::info Why Swarmion?
You can find a detailed explanation of the framework and its tools in the [Why Swarmion?](/docs/why-swarmion) section.
