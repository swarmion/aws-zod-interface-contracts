# VSCode support

Each package in the monorepo is defined as a workspace in the multi-root workspaces. It enables easier browsing and searching features, bringing the same navigation than in a standard codebase.

Using multi-root workspaces makes it possible to use the great [`vitest/vscode` extension](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode), which makes it possible to run and debug tests directly inside VS Code.
